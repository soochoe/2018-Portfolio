# Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! My projects have been categorized into four different categories as seen below.

### __Data Cleaning Projects__
- **Star Wars Survey** - Using Python. Examined and visualized data collected from Star Wars Movies surveys. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis were conducted in a Jupyter notebook to analyze if Star Trek fans were also fans of Star Wars and which Star Wars movie was the best in terms of number of views and ranking. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib. https://github.com/soochoe/Star-Wars-Survey

- **Analyzing NYC High School Data** - Using Python. Examined and visualized relationships between Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and demographic factors in New York City (NYC) public high schools. Eight datasets were merged together into one pandas dataframe. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis were conducted in order to discover if there any ethnic or gender differences in SAT scores and more. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, re, matplotlib. https://github.com/soochoe/Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data

### __End to End Machine Learning Project__
- **Loan Predictions** - Using Python. Performed intensive data preparation necessary to start training models including Data Cleaning, Feature Preparation and EDA. Developed a predictive machine learning model using supervised learning techniques to accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not. Derived a false positive rate of 9% and a true positive rate of 24% using the following classification models: Logistic Regression and Randomforest. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn. https://github.com/soochoe/Loan-Predictions

- **Kepler Exoplanet Project** - Using R. Developed a predictive and planet categorization model using supervised and
unsupervised learning techniques respectively to predict whether a Kepler Object of Interest is classified as a candidate, confirmed or false positive. Derived an accuracy classification rate of 89% by utilizing the following classification techniques: Decision Tree, Randomforest, KNN, SVM, Neural Network. https://github.com/soochoe/Kepler-Exoplanet-Project

### __SQL Projects__
- **SQL Database Project** - Using MySQL. Created an entity-relationship data model using Barker data modelling technique for
a polo club in Denmark and developed a MySQL database using XAMPP platform that aligns with the data model. Populated dataset with test data to allow basic querying and wrote SQL query to analyze the key aspects of the business using the data model.

- **Analyzing Album Sales** - Using Python & SQLite. Discovered the most popular music genre in America by retrieving data using SELECT commands in a Jupyter Notebook and created a graph to visualize the information using Python. Wrote a complex SQL query in order to analyze the amount of album sales to individual tracks. Libaries Used: sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib. https://github.com/soochoe/Analyzing-Album-Sales

### __Data Storytelling Project__
- **Visualizing Gender Gaps in College Degrees** - Using Python. Created and designed plots comparing male and female enrollment across 17 different bachelor degree categories from 1968 to 2011 in order to visualize gender gaps in college throughout time. Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib. https://github.com/soochoe/Visualizing-Gender-Gaps-in-College-Degrees
